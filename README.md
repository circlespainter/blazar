# Blazar - Fiber-blocking HTTP / WebSocket Client and Server APIs

Straightforward, lightning-fast fiber-blocking HTTP / WebSocket Client and Server APIs for Clojure.

*Blazar* uses:

- The [Timbre](https://github.com/ptaoussanis/timbre) Clojure logging framework
- [http-kit](http://http-kit.org/)'s asynchronous HTTP/WebSocket Server and HTTP Client APIs
- [Gniazdo](https://github.com/stylefruits/gniazdo)'s asynchronous WebSocket Client API
- The excellent [Pulsar](https://github.com/puniverse/pulsar) library based on Parallel Universe's [Comsat](https://github.com/puniverse/comsat) stack to provide straightforward, lightning-fast fiber-blocking HTTP/WebSocket Client and Server APIs for Clojure on top of the above

Remember to plug Parallel Univers's [Quasar](https://github.com/puniverse/quasar)'s JVM classes instrumentation.

## Requirements

Clojure 1.6 is required to run Blazar.
