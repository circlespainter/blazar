# Blazar <br/>Straightforward, lightning-fast fiber-blocking HTTP/WebSocket Client and Server APIs for Clojure

Blazar uses:

- The [Timbre](https://github.com/ptaoussanis/timbre) Clojure logging framework
- [http-kit](http://http-kit.org/)'s asynchronous HTTP/WebSocket Server and HTTP Client APIs
- [Gniazdo](https://github.com/stylefruits/gniazdo)'s asynchronous WebSocket Client API
- The excellent [Pulsar](https://github.com/puniverse/pulsar) library based on Parallel Universe's Comsat [Pulsar](https://github.com/puniverse/comsat) stack to provide Straightforward, lightning-fast fiber-blocking HTTP/WebSocket Client and Server APIs for Clojure on top of the above

Remember to plug Parallel Univers's [Quasar]()'s JVM classes instrumentation.

## Requirements

Clojure 1.6 is required to run Blazar.

## Usage

Server example:

```Clojure
(ns main
  (:use
    [co.paralleluniverse.pulsar.core
      :only [spawn-fiber]
    blazar.http.server))

(defn -main []
  (let [server (bind "localhost" 8080)]      ; Bind to localhost's IP and 8080 port
    (loop
      [
        [proto _ :as handle] (listen server) ; Optional :timeout and :timeout-unit parameters
        n 3                                  ; Accepts and processes 3 connections
      ]
      (spawn-fiber (fn []
        (let [data (rcv handle)]             ; Receiving. Optional :close?, :timeout and :timeout-unit parameters
          (cond
            (= proto :ws)                    ; Websocket full-duplex channel is now open until either
                                             ; server or client close it
              (cond
                (:ws-text data)              ; Websocket data
                  (if (= data "Close")
                    (close handle)           ; Client requested to close, so doing it
                    (snd handle "OK"))       ; Echoing. Optional :close?, :timeout and :timeout-unit parameters
                (:ws-close data) nil)        ; Websocket termination, doing nothing

            (= proto :http)                  ; Plain HTTP connection

              (snd handle "Hello world!"))   ; Sends single HTTP response
                                             ; in http kit-compatible format,
                                             ; e.g. string or ring response map

          (close handle))))                  ; Closes the handle if not closed already

      (if (> n 1)                            ; Accepts and processes 3 connections
        (recur (listen server) (- n 1))))

    (unbind server)))                        ; Unbinds server
```

HTTP Client example:

```Clojure
(ns main
  (:use
    [co.paralleluniverse.pulsar.core
      :only [spawn-fiber]
    blazar.http.client))

(defn -main []
  ; You can use all of http-kit's supported HTTP methods
  ; You can pass in http-kit options through an additional map
  ; Return values are http-kit's client one
  (spawn-fiber #(println (bc/http-get "http://localhost:8080"))))
```

HTTP WebSocket example:

```Clojure
(ns main
  (:use
    [co.paralleluniverse.pulsar.core
      :only [spawn-fiber]
    blazar.http.client))

(defn -main []
  (spawn-fiber #(let [handle (ws-open "ws://localhost:8080")]
    (ws-snd handle "Hello world!")     ; Optional ws-rcv parameters: :close? flag, :timeout and :timeout-unit
    (println (:value (ws-rcv handle))) ; :close and :error are also possible keys in result
                                       ; Optional ws-rcv parameters: :close? flag, :timeout and :timeout-unit
    (ws-close handle))))
```
